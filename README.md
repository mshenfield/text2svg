#text2svg
text2svg is a command line tool that turns texts into an array of SVG Path data.  The output can be copied over into projects to let you map objects onto a font path.

## Install
Good old git:

`git clone https://github.com/mshenfield/text2svg`

## Usage
cd into the project directory and use node to run text2svg.js.

`cd text2svg`

`node text2svg.js "Hello world"`

Usage: `node text2svg.js yourText`

There might be support for choosing fonts in the future - right now it will just output SVGized Times New Roman.

## Example
You can find an example application in the [example](https://github.com/mshenfield/text2svg) folder.

It maps circles to SVG paths generated by text2svg and adds some basic animations. Shoutout to [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) and [David Merfield's randomColor](http://llllll.li/randomColor/)
